# vae_frey
Vanilla VAE Frey face generator. 

Take pytorch samples in https://github.com/pytorch/examples 
and adapt the VAE example to learn the frey face manifold
Code is the same except for additional hacks to 
process data, plotting and writing the generator

Heavily inspired by this version for Keras by Elvis Dohmatob:
